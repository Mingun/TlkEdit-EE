# TlkEdit-EE

This is a continuation of the TlkEdit project found at https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/tool/2datlkgff-editor-aka-tlkedit2

Any input is welcome, I hope to be able to expand on this tool.  I do not plan to support the launch4j part that creates the *.exe 32bit-java files.

My main foocus is supporting this project for NWN:EE but hopefully I will not have to break any support for the other games (NWN 1.69, NWN2, Witcher).

If you want spell-check for other languages there are some extra "myspell" format dictionary files at -> http://download.services.openoffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/
Download the desired ones to the /dict folder which should be in the same folder in which the tlkedit.jar file is present,
then update ./dict/dictionaries.properties to include the needed code like the others in the same file.

Build
-----
First, install dependencies into local maven repository. This is temporal solution until
dependencies will be upgraded to one that exists in one of public maven repositories:

```bash
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/jmyspell-1.0.0-beta1.jar -DgroupId=tlkedit -DartifactId=jmyspell -Dversion=1.0.0-beta1 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=./lib
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/swingx.jar -DgroupId=tlkedit -DartifactId=swingx -Dversion=unknown -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=./lib
```

Then build project as usual:

```bash
mvn install
```

### Troubleshooting
If you got error:
```bash
$ mvn install

it means, that you already tried to build project without success and maven cache
unsuccesfull state of dependency resolution. Just add switch `-U` to maven invocation
to force maven re-check dependencies:

```bash
$ mvn -U install
```
