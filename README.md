# TlkEdit-EE

This is a continuation of the TlkEdit project found at https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/tool/2datlkgff-editor-aka-tlkedit2

Any input is welcome, I hope to be able to expand on this tool.  I do not plan to support the launch4j part that creates the *.exe files.

Extra "myspell" format dictionary files can be found -> http://download.services.openoffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/
Download the desired ones to the folder TlkEdit/dict,
then update TlkEdit/dict/dictionaries.properties to include the needed code like the others in the same file.
